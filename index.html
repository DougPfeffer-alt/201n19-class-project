    <p>My most recent job is commercial diving in the Gulf of Mexico. Work below the surface of the water, using surface-supplied air or scuba equipment to inspect, repair, remove or install equipment and structures. May use a variety of power and hand tools, such as drills, sledgehammers, torches, and welding equipment. Before I worked as a commercial diver I worked as an HVAC technician. Previous to HVAC I enlisted in the Marine Corps, infantrymen was my job title. I achieve the rank of CPL and the highest billet I held was a platoon Sgt, as a platoon Sgt you are responsible for 40+ personnel, and equipment. Responsibilities also included the training and combat readiness of each person in the platoon.</p>

      <p>
        My current goals are to achieve a stable career that will give me a good work/life balance. While serving I was fortunate to see unique cultures and countries, not all great, but I still feel it was a significant opportunity. Now I hope a career like software development will give me the chance to see the rest of the world.
